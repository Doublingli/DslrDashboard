Dashboard is an Android application for controlling your DSLR camera
(primary for Nikon) &nbsp;with USB. Unfortunatly not all Android phones
include the required USB support. Currently some of the Android 2.3.x
and 3.x have the required USB support and Android 4.0.x should have it
on all devices.<br>
You can find the application on Google Play for free: <a
 href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dslr.dashboard&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kc2xyLmRhc2hib2FyZCJd">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dslr.dashboard&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kc2xyLmRhc2hib2FyZCJd</a><br>
To use it you need a cheap USB OTG adapter or cable that you can find
on internet.(<a
